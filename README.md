# Discovering Ecuador

In the Pacific coast of South America, just crossed by the Ecuadorian line, we can find one of the most amazing countries in the world.
Its beautiful coasts, its high mountains and volcanos, the wild Amazoninan Rainforest in the west side and those islands, which helped Dariwn
with that book that changed the way to look at the human being, attract thousands of tourists every years.
I am speaking about Ecuador, a little country with 4 different worlds inside it. Ecuador is the perfect destination if you are looking for
fun or relax or adventure and it is also perfect if you go alone or with your family.

## UX

As for the project's title, the main goal of this webside is to inform about Ecuador and its geological structure. The website is
focused to that people who are looking for trvel destination ideas or just someone who needs a general overview on the country for a personal
project or school homworks.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

The project is divided in 6 html files and one css file in order to style them all.

#### Home page

You can find the home page in the index.html file.
It has the same main structure (and background image) as the other pages and its divided as below:

- the header is composed by a navbar where we can find the Ecuadorian flag (that also works as an home link) and the two main links
    - the "home" link that always brings the user to the homepage and the "about" link for the About page

- then we can find the main and secondary titles (differents in each region) followed by a section with an introductory photo of the region
  and a little captive description in order to grab the users's attemption. The photos also work as link to the different regions pages.

- at the very bottom of the page you will find the social networks link (Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter)

#### Regions pages

All the regions pages share the same structure

- a little descriptive introduction which gives some info about the topic

- a photo gallery with 6 or 4 photos depending on the screen size (each photo can be viewed full screen just clicking on it)

- a map (Google map) that should help the user in order to locate the region in the country.

#### About page

The "about" page is focused on who I am and why I chose Ecuador as main topic in the project.
It also provide a "fake" form in order to submit any question the user could have related to Ecuador

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
